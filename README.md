### Spirograph
In this challenge we made a spirograph. We need the turtle to draw a number of circles each with a radius of a hundred in distance.

## üë©‚Äçüé® The Hirst Painting 
The final project was to draw a canva with dots in different colors.
We needed to use the colorgram package to pick the colors from an image and then draw the dots with the color pallete we got.
